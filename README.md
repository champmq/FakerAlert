# FakerAlert

A tool to help with finding FakeDeveloper. <br>
**This tool can not tell if someone is a fake developer or not it only helps with analyzing.**

## Installation & Setup
```bash
 $ pip3 install requests
 $ git clone https://github.com/champmq/FakerAlert.git
 $ cd FakerAlert
 $ python3 FakerAlert.py
```

If you are going to use the tool often you should create a Github App. <br>
Then create a client secret which you can add in `settings.json`

## Usage

## Output
**How to read the output**
The first part of the output are some infos about the username you entered which also includes all the repos he owns/forked. <br>
The second part is the part for the search of a project which your target claims its his. **If nothing was found, he still can be a Developer.**
